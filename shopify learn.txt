What I learned:
1, Selling on Online Marketplaces


Wholesale trade is the practice of a supply or manufacturing business selling products to a retail business, which then sells them to the end customer.
批发贸易是供应或制造业务向零售业务销售产品的做法，然后零售业务再将产品卖给最终客户。

People often refer to wholesalers as an intermediary or ‘middleman’.
人们通常将批发商称为中间商或‘中间人’。


hybrid model: This mix of buying and selling their own stock and providing a space for others to sell too is what we call a hybrid model. It's like combining the best of both worlds — having your own products and also offering a platform for others to sell theirs.



2, Typically, web developers fall into three categories:

Front end developers: Front end developers are responsible for the look and feel of the website. When you see a design change on the homepage of your favorite site, or a new layout for the product pages, they have been updated by a front end developer. This is not to say the developer has designed those features; usually, this is done by a UX (user experience) designer, or a web designer. Shopify gives you all the tools you need to adjust your design by yourself, so you won’t need a developer at this point — which is one of the reasons that Shopify is such a great platform for those new to ecommerce.
Back end developers: A front end developer needs to be supported by a back end developer. Back end developers keep the website’s engine running smoothly. While not dealing with the fun stuff that the front end developers do, the back end developer plays a very important role. A back end developer spends their time writing code and dealing with the server side of the website, including updating a store’s prices, inventory and products. Fortunately, with Shopify, you have pre-built themes that include just about any feature you can think of, from wishlists to inventory management and general content management, so you can build your site without needing a back end developer.
Full stack developers: These are the big cheese in the hamburger! The full stack developer is comfortable managing both the front end and back end parts of a website. A full stack developer isn’t technically better or more skilful than either a front end or back end developer — they are simply proficient in both areas.
